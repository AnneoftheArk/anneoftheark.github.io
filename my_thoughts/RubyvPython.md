## Ruby vs. Python

A question came up as to which would be better to learn first Ruby or Python. I say first because if you learn one language and enjoy coding, it won't be your last. Once you've learned one language learning others is much easier.

My [What Language?](https://AnneoftheArk.github.io/my_thoughts/What_language.html) post provides my take on a post that I found helpful for deciding what language to choose. I come solidly down on Python and I provide my reasoning for that. However, that isn't the "right" answer. The "right" answer is choosing a language that make sense to you for whatever reasons it makes sense to you. 

Below I provide two new links that discuss Ruby vs. Python (because someone asked me about this). These links provide a comparison of the two language that should further help you to decide. Later, I will provide links where you can play with both languages. This will help you decide too.

### Link 1
[Ruby vs. Python 1](https://learn.onemonth.com/ruby-vs-python/)

* Both are easy to learn
* Both have web frameworks if you are interested in web programming
* Both are used a lot and have supportive communities
* Python is easier to debug. This is because Ruby is designed to be more flexible, which means it is harder to find where things go wrong.  However, that flexiblity is a good thing.
* Python is more transparent. Your library calls are explicit, which makes it easier to understand. Ruby is more opaque. The post provides an example of what this means.
* The overall recommendation is: if you have a project for a client or a specific use case for Ruby: learn Ruby. Otherwise, the author recommends Python.

### Link 2
[Ruby vs. Python 2](https://stackify.com/ruby-vs-python/)

* both languages are under license agreements that let you create commercial software with either without license fees.
* Ruby allows rapid development of web sites.
* Python is ubiquitous for data science and machine learning
* Ruby is flexible.
* Python wins the popularity contest at this point. But Ruby is still being used and needs to be maintained.
* More Python jobs than Ruby on popular job sites. BUT Ruby shows a better average salary.
* Both have many libraries and tools that can be used.
* Python is quicker to learn (and once you learn it Ruby will be easier)

While, both of these post land pretty solidly on Python, both indicate that if you have a web project you need to get up and going quickly: Ruby is your better option. However, if that isn't the case: Python is a better first language and will make it easier ultimately to learn Ruby as a second language.
