# What Language Should I Learn

You can find a good blog post regarding how to choose what language you should learn [here] (https://smartbear.com/blog/best-programming-language-to-learn-first/). In this post, I provide a synopsis of this longer post and add thoughts of my own.

First the post lists 5 options:
* Python
* C/C++/C#
* Java
* Javascript
* Ruby

I have coded to some extent in all of these languages. The easiest to learn are Python, Javascript and Ruby. If you are interested in Web programming Javascript and Ruby are very good languages for that task. Python is also used for web development, but I'm not familiar with its uses in this arena.

I would say Java and the C languages are not as easy. However, they are learnable and extremely powerful. Also both are in high demand. Java is used for web programming and application development. C is the basis of most of the other languages. C is also much closer to the hardware layer. So if you want to control hardware, you may want to think about learning C at some point.
C is also used for mobile and app programming, so if you are interested in those aspects of programming you want to (eventually) learn it. 

Cost is not a factor since all of these languages are free to download and use. Some may incur cost to deploy software publicly for money, but you don't have to worry about that yet. 

Ultimately, I would recommend learning Python or Javascript. This is because they are the easiest to learn as well as very widely used. Once you learn one of them, it will be much easier to learn either Java or one of the C-based languages. (Note: Java and Javascript are not related.) While Ruby is also very easy, it isn't a close to traditional programming languages as Python and Javascript. It therefore, makes it less useful as a language to "jump off" from.
